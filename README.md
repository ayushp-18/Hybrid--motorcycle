# Hybrid Motorbike Design and Fabrication

This project focuses on the **design and fabrication of a hybrid electric motorbike** that integrates an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor to promote sustainable and efficient urban mobility. The project demonstrates how hybrid technology can combine the **power and range of gasoline engines** with the **efficiency and eco-friendliness of electric drives**.

## Project Overview
The hybrid motorbike was developed to reduce emissions, improve fuel efficiency, and offer riders flexible power options. The vehicle can operate in **electric mode** for short urban trips or **hybrid mode** for longer distances, ensuring both environmental and performance benefits.

Key aspects of the project include:
- Concept design and CAD modeling of the hybrid drivetrain.
- Integration of BLDC motor, controller, and lithium-ion battery pack.
- Performance testing under real road and environmental conditions.

## Components Used
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| BLDC Motor (1500W) | Provides electric propulsion with high torque efficiency. |
| Li-Ion Battery (60V, 10Ah) | Supplies energy for the electric motor. |
| Controller | Regulates power flow between battery and motor. |
| DC-DC Converter | Stabilizes system voltage. |
| Charger | Recharges the battery safely. |
| Disc Brake System | Ensures effective braking and control. |
| Frame/Chassis | Provides structure and mounting support. |

## Performance Summary
| Parameter | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Peak Speed | 65.3 km/h |
| Average Speed | 48.2 km/h |
| Range per Charge | 25.5 km |
| Peak Efficiency | 41.6% |
| Total Cost | 170,000 PKR |

The prototype demonstrated **stable performance and smooth mode transition** between electric and combustion systems. Efficiency remained consistent across different speed ranges, and regenerative braking improved energy utilization.

## Outcomes
